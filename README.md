# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

## Introduction

In this capstone project, our main objective is to make predictions regarding the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX prominently showcases Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, offering them at a cost of $62 million, whereas other providers charge significantly higher prices, exceeding $165 million per launch. This cost disparity largely stems from SpaceX's unique capability to reuse the first stage, resulting in substantial savings. Consequently, by accurately determining the landing outcome, we can effectively estimate the cost associated with each launch. This valuable information becomes particularly relevant when an alternate company seeks to compete with SpaceX by bidding for a rocket launch opportunity.

This capstone project course serves as a practical introduction to the real-world challenges faced by data scientists when working with authentic datasets. You will assume the role of a Data Scientist employed by a startup aiming to rival SpaceX. Throughout the process, you will follow the Data Science methodology, involving essential steps such as data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your findings to key stakeholders. Your primary responsibility will be to develop a prediction model capable of determining the success or failure of the first stage landing for SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket.

## Business Problem
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if you can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, you can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of your Data Science findings and models, the competing startup you have been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

## Objective
- To apply data science toolkit and machine learning in order to accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, and thus determine the cost of a launch.
- Explore the data in order to obtain more insight from the data.

## Business metric
Classification accuracy - number of correct prediction divided by the total number of prediction defined as:
$$Accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}$$
